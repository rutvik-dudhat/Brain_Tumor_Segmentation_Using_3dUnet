# Brain Tumor Segmentation using 3D U-Net  

## Overview  
This project implements a **3D U-Net model** for brain tumor segmentation using the **BraTS2020 dataset**. The model leverages advanced deep learning techniques to identify and segment tumor regions in MRI scans, with a focus on enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness.  

## Features  
- **3D U-Net architecture** for volumetric segmentation.  
- **Pre-trained ResNet34 backbone** for robust feature extraction.  
- Hybrid loss function: **Dice + Focal loss** to address class imbalance.  
- Comprehensive evaluation using **Dice coefficient, precision, and recall**.  
- **Data augmentation** techniques for improved generalization.  
- Cross-validation for robust performance assessment.  

## Dataset  
The project uses the **BraTS2020 dataset**, which includes:  
- Multi-parametric MRI scans: T1, T1-CE, T2, and FLAIR.  
- Ground truth labels for three tumor regions: enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor.  

> **Note:** Ensure you comply with the datasetâ€™s terms and conditions when downloading and using it.
